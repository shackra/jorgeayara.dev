Welcome!

I started this website out of the necessity of having an online
presence, a place to call *home*. As you may notice, this website
functions as a (technical) blog and as portfolio of projects, it also
has my curriculum vitae, too! This website is my *home* but also a way
to find clients to work for.

If you get a 404 while visiting any of the links in this website,
please forgive me, as it is still under construction; content will
come soon, I promise! ðŸ™ˆ

Until next time!
